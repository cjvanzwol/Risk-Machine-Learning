# Risk Machine Learning
Once upon a time, I made an change calculation in Excel.

Now I'd like to learn Machine Learning and neural networks. So my idea is to program an air for Risk. And then let machine learning create the perfect strategy. 

## TO DO
- program Risk game (grafic or just in python objects)
- make au
- make deep learning framework
- learn deep!!
